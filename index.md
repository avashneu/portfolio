## [Geometric Deep Learning Methods with Deep Chemistry for Drug Pair Interactions](https://github.com/avashneu/cse676project)
*Category: Deep Learning, Autoencoders, Classification*</br>
*Tools: Python, Pytorch, RDKit*

- Obtained the Simplified molecular-input line-entry system(SMILES) component of each drug and performed feature extraction using autoencoders
- Built a multi-class classifier that can predict the interaction class from a range of 86 different interaction classes. 
- Obtained accuracy of 80% (bound to increase further with better computational resources)

## [Ride Hailing Apps(Uber & Lyft Price Prediction](https://github.com/avashneu/Ride-Hailing-Apps-Price-Prediction)
*Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Neural Network, Database Normalization*
- Predicted the fare of a cab ride for certain distances based on external factors such as distance, surge prices, weather conditions.
